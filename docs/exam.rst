Prepare Exam 
=============

This chapter is about setting up and prepare a already imported exam on SEB Server. If you don't have imported a course or quiz from LMS
as an exam into SEB Server, please see the previous chapter for detailed guidance about hot to import an exam.

To find a specific exam that has already been imported, go to "Exam Administration" / "Exam" on the navigation menu on the left hand side to
see a list of all available exams. You are able to filter and sort the list as usual to find to right course for import.

.. note::
    The "Start-Time" filter is usually set to the date one year before now or to some other default date in the past. The list shows only 
    the courses that has a start-time after that time. If you have long running courses and it may possible that a course has been stated
    a year or two ago, you habe to adapt this "Start-Time" filter to view those courses that has been started before. 
    
Double click on the list entry of the exam or select the list entry and use the "View Exam" action of the action pain on the right hand side to
open the exam in the detail view. Within the detail view of the exam you are able to edit the exam attribute, apply SEB exam configuration and
indicators for monitoring as well as defining details of the SEB restriction if this feature is available from the LMS.

.. note::
    If an exam is already running bit is missing some essential setup, this is noted by displaying a red framed message on the top of 
    the side that points out the missing configuration parts. A running exam with missing parts is also marked red in the lists to indicate
    that they are not ready to go and needs some missing setup or preparation.
