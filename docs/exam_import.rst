Import LMS Course as Exam in SEB Server
=======================================

To be able to configure and manage a course or parts of a course existing on a LMS as an exam on SEB Server we first need to import
an exam from the one of the available courses from a LMS that has been setup to use within the SEB Server.

.. note::
    If you don't have already set up a LMS binding within SEB Server and your institution, you have to do this first.
    More information about setting up a LMS binding can be found in the chapter :ref:`lms-setup-label`
    
You will find the list of available courses provided form all LMS that are bound within your institution by going to the "Exam Administration"
section on the left hand side and choosing "LMS Exam Lookup". The SEB Server will present you the list of all available courses and you
are able to filter and sort the list as usual to find to right course for import.

You can view more details of a course by double-click on the specific list entry or by selecting the list entry and click the "Show LMS Exam Details" 
action form the action pain on the right hand side. The application will open a pop-up with available detail information of the course.

To import a specific course as an exam find the specific course on the list by using the filter and select the list entry. Use the "Import As Exam"
