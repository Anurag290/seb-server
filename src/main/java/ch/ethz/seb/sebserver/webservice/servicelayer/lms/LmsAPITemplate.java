/** Defines an LMS API access template to build SEB Server LMS integration.
 * </p>
 * A LMS integration consists of two main parts so far:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * - The course API to search and request course data from LMS as well as resolve some
 *   LMS account details for a given examineeId.
 * - The SEB restriction API to apply SEB restriction data to the LMS to restrict a
 *   certain course for SEB.
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <b>Course API</b></br>
 * All course API requests of this template shall not block and return as fast as possible
 * with the best result it can provide for the time on that the request was made.
 * </p>
 * Since the course API requests course data from potentially thousands of existing and
 * active courses, the course API can implement some caches if needed.</br>
 * A cache in the course API has manly two purposes; The first and prior purpose is to
 * be able to provide course data as fast as possible even if the LMS is not available or
 * busy at the time. The second purpose is to guarantee fast data access for the system
 * if this is needed and data actuality has second priority.</br>
 * Therefore usual get quiz data functions like {@link #getQuizzes(FilterMap filterMap) },
 * {@link #getQuizzes(Set<String> ids) } and {@link #getQuiz(final String id) }
 * shall always first try to connect to the LMS and request the specified data from the LMS.
 * If this succeeds the cache shall be updated with the received quizzes data and return them.
 * If this is not possible within a certain time, the implementation shall get as much of the
 * requested data from the cache and return them to the caller to not block the call too long
 * and allow the caller to return fast and present as much data as possible.</br>
 * This can be done with a {@link MemoizingCircuitBreaker} or a simple {@link CircuitBreaker}
 * with a separated cache, for example. The abstract implementation; {@link AbstractCourseAccess}
 * provides already defined wrapped circuit breaker for each call. To use it, just extend the
 * abstract class and implement the needed suppliers.</br>
 * On the other hand, dedicated cache access functions like {@link #getQuizzesFromCache(Set<String> ids) }
 * shall always first look into the cache to geht the requested data and if not
 * available, call the LMS and request the data from the LMS. If partial data is needed to get
 * be requested from the LMS, this functions shall also update the catch with the requested
 * and cache missed data afterwards.
 * </p>
 * <b>SEB restriction API</b></br>
 * For this API we need no caching since this is mostly about pushing data to the LMS for the LMS
 * to use. But this calls sahl also be protected within some kind of circuit breaker pattern to
 * avoid blocking on long latency.
 * </p>
 * </p>
 * A {@link LmsAPITemplate } will be constructed within the application with a {@link LmsSetup } instances.
 * The application constructs a {@link LmsAPITemplate } for each type of LMS setup when needed or requested and
 * there is not already a cached template or the cached template is out of date.</br>
 * The {@link LmsSetup } defines the data that is needed to connect to a specific LMS instance of implemented type
 * and is wrapped within a {@link LmsAPITemplate } instance that lives as long as there are no changes to the
 * {@link LmsSetup and the {@link LmsSetup } that is wrapped within the {@link LmsAPITemplate } is up to date.
 * <p>
 * The enum {@link LmsSetup.LmsType } defines the supported LMS types and for each type the supported API part(s).
 * <p>
 * The application uses the test functions that are defined for each LMS API part to test API access for a certain LMS
 * instance respectively the underling {@link LmsSetup }. Concrete implementations can do various tests to check full
 * or partial API Access and can flag missing or wrong {@link LmsSetup } attributes with the resulting
 * {@link LmsSetupTestResult }.</br>
 * SEB Server than uses an instance of this template to communicate with the an LMS. */
